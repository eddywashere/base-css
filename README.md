### base-scss

Starting point for css in rails via scss.
Inpired by [mvcss](https://github.com/mvcss/MVCSS).

For new app setup, just trash default stylesheets directory (/app/assets/stylesheets)

In assets directory, clone the project and rename it to stylesheets

    git clone https://github.com/eddywashere/base-scss.git stylesheets

Since this is more of a boilerplate, delete the .git folder and README.md in the stylesheets directory

    rm -rf .git
    rm README.md
